## Introduction

This Python script was built to pull embedded data values associated with a individual Qualtrics survey response from a
user owned Google Sheet and then feed it into the Qualtrics Update Survey Response public API. The use case for this would 
be a need to perform a mass embedded data update to a large number of survey responses where the embedded data values were either not stored with the original response or it was stored incorrectly.
